    <h2>Aim:</h2>
<p>To display the calendar using JavaScript code by getting the year from the user.</p>

<h2>Theory:</h2>
<p>The current task is to build a website that shows a calendar. The ability to go back and forth between months should be available on the calendar. It should be possible for the calendar to show the current date in a different color.</p>
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use a table and the proper list elements to create the calendar's HTML structure.</li>
    <li>Create JavaScript elements to display the current month and year on the page as well as variables to store the current month and year.</li>
    <li>Create a method in JavaScript to show the calendar for the current month. The current month and year should be passed as arguments to this function, which will use them to calculate the number of days remaining in the current month, as well as the day the month began, and then fill in the appropriate number of days in the calendar.</li>
    <li>Make navigational JavaScript functions for the upcoming and prior months.</li>
    <li>The next and previous buttons can be added with JavaScript event listeners, which will cause them to call the proper navigation routines when clicked.</li>
</ul>
